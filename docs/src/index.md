# Julia on HPC clusters

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the notes about the [Julia programming
language](http://www.julialang.org/) on HPC clusters.

## Objective
The goal of these notes is to offer good practices and tips and tricks about how
to use and set up Julia on HPC clusters. The target audiences are therefore
Julia users on clusters as well as HPC system administrators (see the respective
sections in the navigation bar on the left).

## Acknowledgements

These notes don't come out of nowhere but stem from endless conversations with
many people on the Julia discourse, over Slack and Discord, as well as in-person
discussions at Julia HPC minisymposia, BoFs, and workshops.

They also build upon previous efforts to document best practices, most notably
[https://github.com/hlrs-tasc/julia-on-hpc-systems/](https://github.com/hlrs-tasc/julia-on-hpc-systems/),
from which we took (among other things) the [HPC systems with Julia
support](user_hpcsystems.md) information.

The creator and main author is [Carsten Bauer](https://github.com/carstenbauer)
but many members of the Julia HPC community have made valuable contributions.
